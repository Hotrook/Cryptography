# Cryptography

This is repo I used for implementing task for `Cryptography` course on my CS studies.

This repo consist of four projects:
- `l1_prng` - LCG cracker
- `l2_xor` - simple cracker for xor based encryption
- `l3_aes` - encryption app that lets encrypting files using AES cipher
- `l4_merkle` - implementation of one of the first cryptosystems with public key - `Merkle's puzzles`

Each of this four projects contains own `README` with fruther explanation.
